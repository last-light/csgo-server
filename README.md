# CS:GO Surf Server Repository

Welcome to the CS:GO Surf Server repository. This solution is tailored for Linux environments. If you're looking to implement this on a Windows environment, you'll need to make some modifications. Please follow the instructions below to set up the server properly.

## Pre-requisites:

- A Linux environment.
- A working CS:GO server setup.
- Familiarity with setting up and using fastDL servers.

## Installation:

1. **Windows Environment**: If you're on a Windows environment, replace the sourcemod and metadata files with the Windows compatible versions before proceeding.

2. **Extract Files**: All the files from this repository should be extracted into the `/csgo/` folder of your CS:GO server directory.

3. **Add Maps**: Users are required to add their own maps. Ensure to modify the `mapcycle` file accordingly.

4. **Authentication Information**: Some authentication data might be hardcoded into the server setup. It's strongly recommended to replace this with your own information to ensure the security and integrity of your server.

## Additional Notes:

- **fastDL Server**: This solution assumes you have a fastDL server setup and are familiar with the process of syncing files. If not, you'll need to look up documentation or guides on how to set it up.

- **Plugin/Component Documentation**: If you're keen on understanding the setup process of each individual component or plugin, please search for the specific plugin/component name on the internet. There are numerous resources and community forums available that can provide insights into each plugin's workings and configurations.
